                    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                    <h3>How do I create an account?</h3>
                    <p>You can create an account by downloading the Habibi Swipe app and signing up with your email address or Google account. You'll need to verify your email address to complete registration.</p>

                    <h3>What information do I need to provide?</h3>
                    <p>To create a complete profile, you'll need to provide basic information such as your name, date of birth, photos, and preferences. All information is used to help you find compatible matches.</p>

                    <h3>How do I verify my email?</h3>
                    <p>After signing up, you'll receive a verification code via email. Enter this code in the app to verify your account.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Account Management -->
                <div class="support-section">
                    <h2>Account Management</h2>
                    <h3>How do I update my profile?</h3>
                    <p>You can update your profile information at any time by going to the Profile tab in the app and tapping "Edit Profile".</p>

                    <h3>How do I change my email address?</h3>
                    <p>Go to Settings > Account Information to update your email address. You'll need to verify the new email address.</p>

                    <h3>How do I delete my account?</h3>
                    <p>You can delete your account by going to Settings > Delete Account. This action is permanent and cannot be undone. All your data will be removed within 30 days.</p>

                    <h3>I forgot my password</h3>
                    <p>If you signed up with email, you can reset your password by requesting a new verification code. If you signed up with Google, use Google's password recovery.</p>

                    <h2>Matching & Messaging</h2>
                    <h3>How does matching work?</h3>
                    <p>Habibi Swipe uses your preferences and profile information to show you compatible profiles. Swipe right to like someone, or left to pass. When two users like each other, it's a match!</p>

                    <h3>How do I send a message?</h3>
                    <p>Once you've matched with someone, you can send them a message from your chat list. Tap on the match to open the conversation.</p>

                    <h3>What are compliments?</h3>
                    <p>Compliments allow you to send a special message to someone you're interested in, even before matching. If they accept your compliment, you'll automatically match!</p>

                    <h3>How do I unmatch with someone?</h3>
                    <p>You can unmatch with someone by going to your chat with them, tapping the menu (three dots), and selecting "Unmatch". This will remove the match and conversation.</p>
